      "text": "<p>The morning has been an interesting one. I woke up around 11 am after a late night of <a href=\"https://mst3k.com\">Mystery Science Theater 3000</a>. I got up, dressed, and went to do the dishes. I got to the end and lo, some unholy, moldy coffee grounds needed dealt with. My ignorant mind said, \"THROW THEM IN THE HOLE!\", and down they went into the disposal. I turned it on and the hum of death went <i>brrrrrrrr</i>. Maintenance came by and found it wasn't the grounds, but it was sticks...sticks...from outside. My wife has collected sticks on occasion, and we believe our kitties must have dropped the sticks into the disposal as an act of rebellion.<br></br>With my first-world problem resolved, I started on some pasta and meatballs. Vodka sauce has become a secret passion of mine. We found some vegan vodka sauce at Whole Foods, and the meatballs are just the Gardein branch frozen meatballs. I always make <a href=\"https://www.thekitchn.com/instant-pot-spaghetti-264230\">pasta in the Instant Pot</a> and I can't recommend it enough.<br></br>With the pasta done and the rest of the Saturday ahead of me, I think I will daydream about making games and start <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin_Peaks\">Twin Peaks</a>.</p>"

      "text": "<p>Have you ever been playing Blaseball when something really tugged at your heart and made you ask, \"Where am I going to play Papa's Pizzeria after December 2020?\"<br></br>Many browsers are <a href=\"https://support.google.com/chrome/a/answer/7084871\">ending Flash support</a> come December of this year. My generation grew up on these games, and I would argue that these games paved the way for the modern indie video game market. The newest generation won't have these games, but instead has the Android and Apple app stores. Maybe I have nostalgia blinders, but I really do believe that the mediocre titles of the Flash era either matched, or at least came near to matching the quality of modern mobile games. Many influential mobile games even started as Flash, such as Kingdom Rush, Canabalt, and Bloons Tower Defense.<br></br>Flash is not inherently good. From a technical standpoint, we have made incredible progress in enabling developers to build their creations beyond the likes of Flash. The spirit of Flash is what was special. Before commercialization and ad profits entered the picture, these games were made by developers with simple wishes to share their dreams with others.<br></br>I work on games in the hopes of pushing myself and others to do this very thing. In the memory of Flash, I will continue to recreate my favorite Flash games on this site, and hopefully bring some unique creations up along the way.</p>"

      "text": "<p>Oh dear Lord there has been a lot since last time. Amongst an insurrection on the US capitol and a stock war over GameStop, my wife and I bought a house and got a third cat, Fish.<br></br>I learned a few new programming languages including two new favorites of mine: <a href=\"https://www.scala-lang.org\">Scala</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nim-lang.org\">Nim<a> (<i>All good languages seem to have website domains of the form www.[language name here]-lang.com</i>). I mostly ported the Komodo game engine to Scala using LibGDX and only gave up once Java UI threads were getting in the way of easy UI development. It was fun and all, but I think the real winner and final home for the Komodo engine is with Nim.<br></br>Nim satisfies my urge to write what looks like pseudocode while enjoying the benefits of a statically typed and compiled language. No attempt by the Nim developers to make a compiler smarter than two of some of the largest open-source communities (<a href=\"https://gcc.gnu.org/\">GCC</a> and <a href=\"https://clang.llvm.org/\">Clang</a>), but instead harnesses these behemoths by simply generating C-family code and passing it off to your local system compiler. With a powerful macro system, Komodo has never looked better and I am excited to see what can be done with Nim and Raylib.<br></br>Apart from code, my life has changed in other ways. My teammates at work left for other teams or other companies, leaving me alone to develop and maintain an app servicing a workforce around ~2,000 strong. I am excited to say that this will not be the case forever, as I will be transitioning to an SRE position once my project is ready to hand off to a new team. Work is great. Life is great. For those who cannot say these same things for themselves, reach out to those who love you and have faith that this will all come to an end eventually.</p>"
